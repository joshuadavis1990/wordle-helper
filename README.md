## Features of Wordle Helper

*Wordle Helper* is an intelligent command line application that:

1. Assists the user in solving *Wordle* puzzles by locally prompting them throughout their six attempts at https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html
2. Dynamically searches through the current *Wordle* dictionary of approximately 2000 5 letter words to narrow down the possible word candidates each day
3. Provides the user with an easy coding system to input *Wordle* data: G = Green, Y = Yellow, X = Grey (e.g. XXXYG)
4. Reads and responds to the symbols in the user's input

## Styling Conventions

*Wordle Helper* uses the *PEP 8 â€“ Style Guide for Python Code* by Guido van Rossum: https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/
