## Features of Wordle Helper

*Wordle Helper* is an intelligent command line application that:

1. Assists the user in solving *Wordle* puzzles by locally prompting them throughout their six attempts at https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html
1. Dynamically searches through the current *Wordle* dictionary of approximately 2000 5 letter words to narrow down the possible word candidates each day
1. Provides a small list of random words from the Wordle dictionary the user may choose to input at the start of the program
1. Includes an easy coding system for the user to input *Wordle* data: G = Green, Y = Yellow, X = Grey (e.g. XXXYG)
1. Reads and responds to the symbols in the user's input
1. Presents the user with, after each of their six possible attempts, a short list of words that contain the most frequent letters used in the Wordle word bank

## Styling Conventions

*Wordle Helper* uses the *PEP 8 â€“ Style Guide for Python Code* by Guido van Rossum: https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/
